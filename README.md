# Web Storage Guide

## Overview

This Web Storage Guide is a comprehensive resource for understanding various web storage mechanisms available in modern web development. It provides detailed explanations, comparisons, and interactive demos for different storage types.

## Contents

The guide covers the following storage types:

1. Local Storage
2. Session Storage
3. IndexedDB
4. Cookies
5. Cache Storage
6. Storage Bucket
7. Shared Storage

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main page with overview of all storage types
- `local-storage-demo.html`: Interactive demo for Local Storage
- `session-storage-demo.html`: Interactive demo for Session Storage
- `indexeddb-demo.html`: Interactive demo for IndexedDB
- `cookies-demo.html`: Interactive demo for Cookies
- `cache-storage-demo.html`: Interactive demo for Cache Storage
- `storage-bucket-demo.html`: Conceptual demo for Storage Bucket
- `shared-storage-demo.html`: Conceptual demo for Shared Storage

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the main guide.
3. Click on the "Demo" links for each storage type to see interactive examples.

## Demo Pages

Each demo page provides:
- A brief explanation of the storage mechanism
- Interactive elements to test storage operations
- Visual feedback on storage actions

## Notes

- The Storage Bucket and Shared Storage demos are conceptual, as these APIs are newer and may not be fully supported in all browsers.
- For the Cache Storage demo, you may need to run the files through a local server due to Service Worker requirements.

## Browser Compatibility

Most demos should work in modern browsers. However, some newer APIs (like Storage Bucket and Shared Storage) may not be fully supported. Always check current browser compatibility when implementing these storage mechanisms in production.
